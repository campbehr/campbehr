# Hi 🙋‍♂️

My name is Hunter Campbell and I'm a project manager and UI/UX developer. I'm originally from South Carolina but I live in Baltimore, MD. My hobbies include weightlifting, cooking, coding, and playing with my doggo, Maverick 🐺.

## Looking for

Right now I'm looking to join a company that will challenge me and allow me to grow as a project manager and collaborate with a team. If I get to learn new technologies along the way all the better!
